# 📦 Archive

This folder contains the **old, unorganized structure** that was reorganized on 2025-09-07.

## 🗂️ **What's Archived**

### **script_4_studies/** - Old Messy Folder
This contained 40+ loose Python files that were hard to navigate. **All files have been moved to the new organized structure.**

**Where they went:**
- Chain basics → `../learning/01_fundamentals/chains/`
- Output parsers → `../learning/02_advanced/output_parsers/`
- Chatbots → `../learning/02_advanced/memory/` and `../projects/chatbot/`
- Experiments → `../experiments/2025-09-07_*/`

### **examples/** - Old Examples Folder
Simple examples that were scattered. **Reorganized into appropriate learning modules.**

**Where they went:**
- Basic examples → `../learning/01_fundamentals/`
- Advanced examples → `../learning/02_advanced/output_parsers/`

### **chain_roteiro_viagem/** - Old Travel Project
Single travel chain example. **Moved to organized project structure.**

**Where it went:**
- Main file → `../projects/travel_agent/src/`

## 🔄 **Migration Summary**

| Original Location | New Location | Count |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| `script_4_studies/` | `learning/` + `projects/` + `experiments/` | 40+ files |
| `examples/` | `learning/02_advanced/output_parsers/` | 3 files |
| `chain_roteiro_viagem/` | `projects/travel_agent/src/` | 1 file |

## 🎯 **Why This Was Archived**

### **Problems with Old Structure:**
- ❌ Too many files in one folder
- ❌ No clear learning progression  
- ❌ Mixed concerns (tutorials, projects, experiments)
- ❌ Hard to find specific concepts
- ❌ No documentation or guidance

### **Benefits of New Structure:**
- ✅ Progressive learning path
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Easy to find specific topics
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ Production-ready examples

## 🚀 **How to Use the New Structure**

Instead of looking here, use the new organized structure:

### **For Learning:**
```bash
cd ../learning/01_fundamentals/chains/
```

### **For Projects:**
```bash
cd ../projects/chatbot/src/
```

### **For Experiments:**
```bash
cd ../experiments/2025-09-07_chain_pais_capital_curiosidade/
```
